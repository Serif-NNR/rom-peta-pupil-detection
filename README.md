## Academic side


- If you would like to access the academic article of this study, named ROM and PETA, which is derived from the eye-tracking system called Fixein:

<br/>

- For the master's thesis of the comprehensive work called Fixein, which also covers ROM-PETA:

## Purpose of this Repository

Fixein, as a comprehensive system, encompasses analysis tools, a pupil detector (as shared in this repo), application software, hardware design, hardware prototyping, implementations of other related academic studies, and additional components intended for eye-tracking purposes (e.g., calibration).

The prepared work has been structured in two parts: the pupil detector and the remainder of the system. Through this repository, you can only access the pupil detector implementation and some analysis files.

With the publication of the academic study referring to the entirety of Fixein (i.e., the remainder of the system), it is planned to share all application code in a separate repository and to provide a reference to it here as well.
